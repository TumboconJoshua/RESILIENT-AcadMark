          "abstract": "Water scarcity is a growing global issue, making efficient water management crucial for agriculture. Traditional irrigation systems often lead to excessive water usage, resulting in waste and higher costs. This research introduces a Smart Irrigation System, an innovative approach that utilizes moisture sensors, IoT technology, and automation to optimize water distribution and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The system integrates soil moisture sensors, IoT connectivity, and automated watering mechanisms to reduce water consumption by up to 40%. By leveraging real-time data and weather forecasts, this solution enhances efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. The Smart Irrigation System provides a scalable solution to water conservation challenges, supporting sustainable farming and environmental preservation."
